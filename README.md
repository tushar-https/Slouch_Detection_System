# Slouch Detection System

## Project Overview
The **Slouch Detection System** transforms a standard chair into a smart device capable of detecting slouching behavior. By leveraging machine learning and sensor-based inputs, the system identifies poor posture and provides real-time feedback to promote healthier sitting habits.

## Key Features
- **Posture Detection:** Utilizes flex sensors to detect deviations in posture.
- **Machine Learning Integration:** Neural Network trained on a custom dataset for accurate slouch detection.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Visual and auditory notifications through a web-based interface.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Interactive GUI built using React and AJAX.
- **Modular Design:** System designed for scalability and future enhancements.
